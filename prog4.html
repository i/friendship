<p><a name="bg"></a></p><h3><a name="bg">Background</a></h3>

<p>In this program, you will implement some useful algorithms for
graphs that represent friendships, such as Facebook. A friendship graph
is an undirected graph without any weights on the edges. It is a simple
graph because there are no self loops (a self loop is an edge from a vertex to
itself), or multiple edges (a multiple edge means more than edge between a
pair of vertices).

</p><p>The vertices in the graphs for this assignment represent two kinds of people:
students and non-students. Each vertex will store the name of the person.
If the person is a student, the name of the school will also be stored.

</p><p>Here's a sample friendship graph:
</p><pre>     (sam,rutgers)---(jane,rutgers)-----(bob,rutgers)   (sergei,rutgers)
                          |                 |             |
                          |                 |             |
                     (kaitlin,rutgers)   (samir)----(aparna,rutgers)
                          |                            |
                          |                            |
  (ming,penn state)----(nick,penn state)----(ricardo,penn state)
                          |
                          |
                     (heather,penn state)


                   (michele,cornell)----(rachel)     
                          | 
                          | 
     (rich,ucla)---(tom,ucla)
</pre>
Note that the graph may not be connected, as seen in this example in which there
are two "islands" or cliques that are not connected to each other by any edge.
Also see that all the vertices represent students with names of schools, except for
<tt>rachel</tt> and <tt>samir</tt>, who are not students.

<p></p><hr>
<p><a name="algo"></a></p><h3><a name="algo">Algorithms</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>
<p><a name=""></a></p><h4><a name="">Subgraph: Students at a school</a></h4>

<p>You want to be able to focus exclusively on students in a particular school, and
all the friendships between them. To do this, you will have to extract an
appropriate subgraph out of the full graph. Here is the subgraph of students at
rutgers, extracted from the original sample graph:

</p><pre>     (sam,rutgers)---(jane,rutgers)-----(bob,rutgers)    (sergei,rutgers)
                          |                                |
                          |                                |
                     (kaitlin,rutgers)             (aparna,rutgers)
</pre>

</li><li><p><a name=""></a></p><h4><a name="">Shortest path: Intro Chain </a></h4>

<p><tt>sam</tt> wants an intro to <tt>aparna</tt> through friends and friends
of friends. There are two possible chains of intros:
</p><pre>  sam--jane--kaitlin--nick--ricardo--aparna
            or
  sam--jane-bob--samir--aparna
</pre>
The second chain is preferable since it is shorter. 

<p>If <tt>sam</tt> wants to be introduced to <tt>michele</tt> through a chain of
friends, he is out of luck since there is no chain that leads from <tt>sam</tt> to
<tt>michele</tt> in the graph.

</p><p>Note that this algorithm does NOT have any restriction on the composition of the
vertices: a vertex along the shortest chain need NOT be a student at a particular
school, or even a student. So, for instance, you may have to find the shortest intro
chain from <tt>nick</tt> to <tt>samir</tt>, which has the following solution:
</p><pre>   nick--ricardo--aparana--samir
</pre>
which consists of two penn state students, one rutgers student, and one non-student.

</li><li><p><a name=""></a></p><h4><a name="">Connected Islands: Cliques</a></h4>

<p>Students tend to form cliques with their friends, which creates
islands that do not connect with each other. If these cliques could be identified,
particularly in the student population at a particular school,
introductions could be made between people in different cliques to build larger
networks of friendships at that school. 

</p><p>In the sample graph, there are two island cliques for students at rutgers:
</p><pre>     (sam,rutgers)---(jane,rutgers)-----(bob,rutgers)    (sergei,rutgers)
                          |                                |
                          |                                |
                     (kaitlin,rutgers)             (aparna,rutgers)
</pre>

<p>If we were to look at students at penn state, instead, there is a single clique:
</p><pre>   (ming,penn state)----(nick,penn state)----(ricardo,penn state)
                          |
                          |
                     (heather,penn state)
</pre>
<p>And again, a single clique for students at ucla:
</p><pre>     (rich,ucla)---(tom,ucla)
</pre>
<p>And one for students at cornell:
</p><pre>             (michele,cornell)
</pre>
<p>From these examples, it should be clear that if there is at least one student
in the graph that goes to a particular school, then there must be at least one
island clique in the graph for students at that school.

</p></li><li><p><a name=""></a></p><h4><a name="">Connectors: Friends who keep friends together </a></h4>

<p>If <tt>jane</tt> were to leave rutgers, <tt>sam</tt> would no longer be able to
connect with anyone else--<tt>jane</tt> was the "connector" who could pull
<tt>sam</tt> in to hang out with her other friends. Similarly, <tt>aparna</tt>
is a connector, since without her, <tt>sergei</tt> would not be able to 
"reach" anyone else. (And there are more connectors in the graph...)

</p><p>On the other hand <tt>samir</tt> is not a connector. Even if he were to leave,
everyone else could still "reach" whoever they could when <tt>samir</tt> was there,
even though they may have to go through a longer chain.

</p><p>A precise definition of a connector in any undirected graph is a vertex, v,
such that there are at least two other vertices x and w for which <em>every</em> path
between x and w goes through v. For example, <tt>v=jane</tt>,
<tt>x=sam</tt>, and <tt>w=bob</tt>.

</p><p>Finding all connectors in an undirected graph can be done using DFS (depth-first search),
but keeping track of a couple more numbers for every vertex <tt>v</tt>. These are:
</p><ul>
<li><tt>dfsnum(v)</tt>: This is the dfs number, assigned when a vertex is visited, dealt out
in increasing order.
</li><li><tt>back(v)</tt>: This is a number that is initially assigned when a vertex is
visited, and is equal to <tt>dfsnum</tt>, but can be changed later based on three conditions:
<ul>
<li>When the DFS backs up from a neighbor, <tt>w</tt>, to <tt>v</tt>,
if <tt>dfsnum(v)</tt> &gt; 
<tt>back(w)</tt>, then <tt>back(v)</tt> is set to min(<tt>back(v)</tt>,<tt>back(w)</tt>)
</li><li>If a neighbor, <tt>w</tt>, is already visited then
<tt>back(v)</tt> is set to min(<tt>back(v)</tt>,<tt>dfsnum(w)</tt>)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>When the DFS backs up from a neighbor, <tt>w</tt>, to <tt>v</tt>,
if <tt>dfsnum(v)</tt> &#8804; <tt>back(w)</tt>, then <tt>v</tt> is identified as
a connector, IF <tt>v</tt> is NOT the starting point
for the DFS.
(If <tt>v</tt> is a starting point for DFS, it can be a connector, but
another check must be made - see the examples below. The examples don't tell
you how to identify such cases, that's up to you.)

</p><p>Here are some examples that show how this works. 

</p><ul>
<li>Example 1: (B is a connector)
<pre>    A--B--C
</pre>
The DFS starts at A. Neighbors for a vertex are stored in REVERSE alphabetical order:
<pre>  
  A: B
  B: C,A
  C: B

  dfs @ A  1/1  (dfsnum/back)
      dfs @ B 2/2
          dfs @ C 3/3
              neighbor B is already visited =&gt; C 3/2
          dfsnum(B) &lt;= back(C) B is a CONNECTOR
          nbr A is already visited =&gt; B 2/1
      dfsnum(A) &lt;= back(B) A is starting point of DFS, NOT connector
</pre>

<p></p></li><li>Example 2: (B is a connector)
<pre>   A--B--C
</pre>
The same example as the first, except DFS starts at B. This shows how even thought B is
the starting point, it is still identified (correctly) as a connector. The code is
not complete because it does not show HOW B is determined to be a connector
in the last line - that's for you to figure out. Neighbors are
stored in reverse alphabetical order as before.
<pre>  dfs @ B  1/1 
      dfs @ C 2/2
          nbr B is already visited =&gt; C 2/1
      dfsnum(B) &lt;= back(C) B is starting point, NOT connector
      dfs @ A 3/3
          nbr B is already visited =&gt; A 3/1
      dfsnum(B) &lt;= back(A) B is starting point, but is a CONNECTOR
</pre>

<p></p></li><li>Example 3: (B and D are connectors)
<pre>    A---B---C
        |   |
        E---D---F
</pre>
<p>DFS starts at A. Neighbors stored in reverse alphabetical order again:
</p><pre>  A: B
  B: E,C,A
  C: D,B
  D: F,E,C
  E: D,B
  F: D

  dfs @ A 1/1
      dfs @ B 2/2
          dfs @ E 3/3
              dfs @ D 4/4
                  dfs @ F 5/5
                      nbr D is already visited =&gt; F 5/4
                  dfsnum(D) &lt;= back(F) =&gt; D is a CONNECTOR
                  nbr E already visited =&gt; D 4/3
                  dfs @ C 6/6
                      nbr D already visited =&gt; C 6/4
                      nbr B already visited =&gt; C 6/2
                  dfsnum(D) &gt; back(C) =&gt; D 4/2
              dfsnum(E) &gt; back(D) =&gt; E 3/2
              nbr B is already visited =&gt; E 3/2
          dfsnum(B) &lt;= back(E) =&gt; B is a CONNECTOR
          nbr C is already visited =&gt; B 2/2
          nbr A is already visited =&gt; B 2/1
      dfsnum(A) &lt;= back(B) A is starting point, NOT connector
</pre>

<p></p></li><li>Example 4: (B and D are connectors)
<pre>    A---B---C
        |   |
        E---D---F
</pre>
<p>Same example as the previous, except DFS starts at D, and neighbors stored
in alphabetical order. Connectors are still correctly identified as B and D.
</p><pre>  A: B
  B: A,C,E
  C: B,D
  D: C,E,F
  E: B,D
  F: D

  dfs @ D 1/1
      dfs @ C 2/2
          dfs @ B 3/3
              dfs @ A 4/4
                  nbr B is already visited =&gt; A 4/3
              dfsnum(B) &lt;= back(A) =&gt; B is a CONNECTOR
              nbr C is already visited =&gt; B 3/2
              dfs @ E 5/5
                  nbr B is already visited =&gt; E 5/3
                  nbr D is already visited =&gt; E 5/1
              dfsnum(B) &gt; back(E) =&gt; B 3/1
          dfsnum(C) &gt; back(B) =&gt; C 2/1
          nbr D is already visited =&gt; C 2/1
      dfsnum(D) &lt;= back(C) D is starting point, NOT connector
      dfs @ F 6/6
          nbr D is already visited =&gt; F 6/1
      dfsnum(D) &lt;= back(F) D is starting point, is a CONNECTOR

<a name="impl"><h3>Implementation</h3></a>

<p>You will write a program called <tt>Friends</tt> that will read a graph file,
build a graph (using the adjacency linked lists representation), and implement the
four algorithms described above. The following describes the inputs and outputs
for all the functionality you need to implement, as well as point assignment.

</p><ol>
<li><a name=""><h4>(5 pts) User interface</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Your user interface should ask for the input graph file, build the graph,
then spin on five choices--students at a school, shortest intro chain, cliques at
school, connectors, and quit--until the user quits.
</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(10 pts) Graph build</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Input: file that lists names of all people and edges between them. Here is 
the format of the input file for the sample friendship graph given in the
<tt>Background</tt> section.
<pre>   15
   sam|y|rutgers
   jane|y|rutgers
   michele|y|cornell
   sergei|y|rutgers
   ricardo|y|penn state
   kaitlin|y|rutgers
   samir|n
   aparna|y|rutgers
   ming|y|penn state
   nick|y|penn state
   bob|y|rutgers
   heather|y|penn state

   bob|samir
   sergei|aparna
   samir|aparna
   aparna|ricardo
   nick|ricardo
   ming|nick
   heather|nick
   michele|rachel
   michele|tom
   tom|rich
</pre>
<p>The first line has the number of people in the graph (15 in this case). 

</p><p>The next set of lines has information about the people in the graph, one line per
person (15 lines in this example), with the '|' used to separate the fields. 
In each line, the first field is the name of
the person. Names of people can have any character except '|', and are case
<em>insensitive</em>. The second field is 'y' if
the person is a student, and 'n' if not. The third field is 
only present for students, and is the name of the school the student attends.
The name of a school can have any character except '|', and is
case <em>insensitive</em>.

</p><p>The last set of lines, following the people information, lists the friendships
between people, one friendship per line. Since friendship works both ways, any
friendship is only listed once, and the order in which the names of the friends
is listed does not matter.

</p></li><p></p><li>Result: The ajacency linked list representation, along with a data structure
to be able to quickly translate from a person's name to vertex number. There should
also be a quick way to translate from vertex number to the person's
name. 
<p></p></li><li>Output: <font color="red">You don't have to print the representation, we
will check your code to see if you are storing the graph in this representation.</font>
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(15 pts) Subgraph (students at a school)</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Input: Name of school (case insensitive), e.g. "penn state"
</li><p></p><li>Result: Subgraph of original graph, vertices are all students at the given school,
edges are a subset of the edges of the original graph such that both endpoints are
students at the school. The subgraph must be in stored in the adjacency linked
lists form, just as for the original graph.
<p></p></li><li>Output: Print the subgraph in the same format as the
input in the <b>Graph build</b> section above.
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(20 pts) Shortest path (Intro chain)</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Input: Name of person who wants the intro, and the name of the other person,
e.g. "sam" and "aparna" for the graph in the Background section. 
(Neither of these, nor any of the intermediate people are
required to be students, in the same school or otherwise.)
</li><p></p><li>Result: The shortest chain of people in the graph
starting at the first and ending at the second. 
<p></p></li><li>Output: Print the chain of people in the shortest path, for example:
<pre>sam--jane-bob--samir--aparna
</pre>
If there is no way to get from the first person to the second person, then the 
output should be a message to this effect.
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(15 pts) Connected Islands (cliques)</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Input: Name of school for which cliques are to be found, e.g. "rutgers"
</li><p></p><li>Result: The subgraphs for each of the cliques. 
<p></p></li><li>Output: Print the subgraph for each clique, in the same format as
the input described in the <tt>Graph build</tt> section. For example:
<pre>Clique 1:

&lt;subgraph output&gt;

Clique 2:

&lt;subgraph output&gt;

etc...
</pre>

Note: If there is even one student at the named school in the graph, then
there must be at least
one clique in the output. If the graph has no students at all at that school,
then the output will be empty. 
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(25 pts) Connectors (Friends who keep friends together)</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Input: Nothing
</li><p></p><li>Result: Names of all people who are connectors in the graph
<p></p></li><li>Output: Print names of all people who are connectors in the graph, comma
separated, in any order.
</li></ul>
<p></p></li><li><a name=""><h4>(10 pts) Efficiency</h4></a>
<ul>
<li>Your program will be assessed for efficiency in space usage and running time.
Assume that the input graph in general can have several tens of thousands
of vertices (people), and that each person will have, on average, about 100 friends.
Think carefully through the algorithms to make sure you implement them as efficiently
as you can.

<p>Remember, translating between a person's name and vertex number, as well as the other
way around, should done efficiently. When implementing the algorithms, you will
need to maintain additional data structures--pay particular attention to the space
you use for the data structures. 

</p></li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p>Your program MUST be called <tt>Friends</tt> - in other words, you must have a filed
named <tt>Friends.java</tt> with a <tt>main</tt> method.

</p><p>You may implement as many classes as you want, and separate them into packages as needed.

</p><p>You may import any of the classes from <tt>java.lang</tt>, 
<tt>java.io</tt> and <tt>java.util</tt>, but you may NOT 
import classes from any of the other packages in the standard Java API, and you may NOT 
import classes from any external java APIs. (Of course, if you have more than one package in your 
application, you can cross-import classes among them.) Note: The <tt>java.util.TreeMap</tt> 
class may be useful--it implements a red-black
tree, which, like the AVL tree, is a balanced binary search tree with O(log n) worst case
insert/delete/search times.

</p><h3><a name="submit">Submission</a></h3>

In the <tt>Friends.java</tt> file, <font color="red">make sure you write the names of
both members of your team in comment lines at the top. </font>
<p>Export your entire Eclipse project as a zip archive into a file called
<tt>friends.zip</tt>, 
and upload this file to Sakai. (See the Eclipse page for how to do this.)

</p><p>If you submit an 
incorrect/incomplete project, you will lose credit. So before you submit,
you should check that all is well by importing your friends.zip file as a project
into Eclipse (in a different workspace, so it doesn't conflict with your
existing project), and running it.

</p><p>ONLY ONE PERSON per team should submit the assignment.
